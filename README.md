## 📅 Day-01: Introduction to Cybersecurity

### 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

### 💼 What Do We Do in Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity professionals:
- Identify and analyze threats
- Monitor networks for breaches
- Implement secure network solutions
- Test systems for vulnerabilities
- Respond to incidents and recover systems
- Educate users and promote safe practices

### ⚠️ Types of Cybersecurity Threats

1. **Phishing**  
   Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in digital communication.

2. **Ransomware**  
   Malware that locks or encrypts your files and demands payment for the decryption key.

3. **Malware**  
   Malicious software designed to cause damage or unauthorized access to systems (e.g., viruses, worms, trojans).

4. **Social Engineering**  
   Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information through deception and psychological manipulation.

5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**  
   An attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.

6. **Zero-Day Attack**  
   Attacks that exploit unknown vulnerabilities in software before developers have issued a fix.

### 🎯 Importance of Cybersecurity

- Protects sensitive data and personal information
- Maintains business continuity
- Prevents financial loss and reputational damage
- Ensures regulatory compliance
- Protects critical infrastructure and national security

### 🛤️ How to Become a Cybersecurity Professional – Roadmap

1. **Basic IT Skills**
