### 🔍 What Do We Do in Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity professionals:
- Monitor networks for threats
- Detect and respond to attacks
- Protect sensitive data
- Test systems for weaknesses (vulnerabilities)
- Educate users about safe practices
- Ensure systems follow security rules (compliance)

### ⚠️ Types of Cybersecurity Threats

1. **Phishing**
   - Fake emails or messages trick you into giving sensitive information.

2. **Ransomware**
   - Malicious software that locks your data and demands money to unlock it.

3. **Malware**
   - Any software designed to harm your computer (e.g., virus, trojan, worm).

4. **Social Engineering**
   - Tricking people into giving up information by pretending to be someone they trust.

5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**
   - Attacker secretly intercepts or changes communication between two people/systems.

6. **Zero-Day Attack**
   - An attack that targets unknown software vulnerabilities before they’re fixed.
